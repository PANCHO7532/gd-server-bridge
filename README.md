# Geometry Dash Server Bridge
## Connect Geometry Dash clients to multiple servers.
With this new script, you can connect to other Geometry Dash servers stored in the web without editing over and over the game files.

## Features
This project contains the following features:

- The bridge supports client versions: 1.0 - 1.9 (in the future will it be more support)

- You can connect to Robtop's server in older versions but don't works very well.
## Installing
The installation its easy, the script doesn't needs SQL DB'S.

- Only download and put it in a folder in your website, then, follow the same steps in the GDPS project to change the url in the game files. With the diferrence in the url, this needs to redirect to this script.

- Edit config.inc.php and edit the "$server" var with the server address to connect

- Also you can connect to Robtop's server (http://www.boomlings.com/database) and play in older versions.

## Warnings
- Dont put the files in the same folder of GDPS (if you have one configured put it in a different folder)

## TO-DO List
- Support for newer versions (probably all versions, idk)

- In future releases maybe i will add an compatibility mode to force a good response in Robtop's Server.
