# Geometry Dash Server Bridge
## Connect Geometry Dash clients to multiple servers.
With this new script, you can connect to other Geometry Dash servers stored in the web without editing over and over the game files.

## Installing
The installation its easy, the script doesn't needs SQL DB'S.

- Only download and put it in a folder in your website, then, follow the same steps in the GDPS project to change the url in the game files. With the diferrence in the url, this needs to redirect to this script.

- Edit config.inc.php and edit the "$server" var with the server address to connect

- Also you can connect to Robtop's server (http://www.boomlings.com/database) and play in older versions.

## Warnings
- Dont put the files in the same folder of GDPS (if you have one configured put it in a different folder)

- The support its only for 1.7 - older version at this time, maybe can be an partial support for 1.8 - 1.9 clients

## TO-DO List
- Support for newer versions (probably all versions, idk)
